## Now you are ready to publish your Markdown document online.

# Overview of publishing a Markdown document online

* Markdown documents on their own are just lines of text and code that include information on what the document would and should look like when published

* The code and syntax that you have placed in your Markdown document needs to be read and interpreted by a computer who understands Markdown language. This is called `parsing` of the Markdown document and the computer that knows how to read and interpret Markdown is called a `parser`

* After `parsing`, the computer will then convert your Markdown document into another format that is ready for online publication. This format is called `HTML` format

* Once converted, your document is then published online ready to be viewed by yourself and others on the internet

# Our workflow for publishing Markdown to online newspaper

* You will notice that in our workflow, all we have to do are **Step 1** and **Step 2**.

* **Step 3** and **Step 4** are all done automatically for us.

* The online tools that help us with **Step 3** and **Step 4** are **GitHub**, **Hugo**, and **Netlify**

```{r workflow3, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "33.3%"}

# Our workflow for publishing Markdown to online newspaper

* By now, you would have completed **Step 1** already after our first tutorial.

* We will now focus on completing **Step 2**.

* For this step, you will need:

    - A computer that can get on the internet;

    - The Markdown document/s that you have already converted into Markdown;

    - Permission from your parents and a little bit of help in doing all the online stuff;

## Sign-in to GitHub

* Our most important tool for **Step 2** is **GitHub**

* **GitHub** is an online tool used mostly by people who write code for developing various kinds of software or for creating various online materials such as websites. **GitHub** allows its users to keep or save their code into repositories and **GitHub** provides tools for sending different kinds of code to its specific interpreter or parser to produce output.

* We have created generic **GitHub** accounts for each member of the Class 3EE News Team. Details of your accont have been provided to your parents. Please ask them for this and ask them to help you log-in.

* Sign in to **GitHub** at https://github.com/login using the login details provided
